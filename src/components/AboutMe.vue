              About Me
            </base-heading>

            <base-text>
              I have always been a lover of languages. My first memories were teaching myself English while watching movies and then repeating the words to anyone who would listen. This initial spark created a passion to master English which lead me to become a translator for the US Army. Language, has the power to create connections and influence people.
              <br><br>
              My love of languages has evolved with my career trajectory, so, itâ€™s no surprise I found the same spark when introduced to programing languages. In code, I have the same power to create connections and influence people for good through my applications.
